      What follows below is a list of stories which are not only good stories but in addition have gone above and beyond being just
      good stories and have spoken to some deeply felt aspects of life. So that the stories stay with you long after you've read them
      and pay off re-reading with newer undiscovered depths and meanings.
      I've to say, the first and the last on this list made the greatest impression on me.
